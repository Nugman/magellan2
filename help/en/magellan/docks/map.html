    <h1>Karte</h1>
    <p>Here the map of the known world is displayed.</p>
    <p style="text-align: center">
      <img src="../images/windows_map.gif" alt="" border="0" />
    </p>
    <p>
      When "Fog of War" (FOW) is enabled, regions that do not contain units or
      have not been traveled through, as well as ocean regions that can not be
      glimpsed from atop a lighthouse, are displayed darker. This mode can be
      toggled with shortcut key <b>CTRL-W</b>.
    </p>
    <p>If you click on the map the selected region is opened in the region
      view. By holding down the mouse button you can pan the map.</p>
    <p>
      Above the map there is a zoom bar that controls the magnification of the
      map. Additionally you might find two drop-down menus here. One for
      planes, if you happen to have units in several planes, and one that
      allows you to choose so-called hotspots. You can add a hotspot by
      pressing <b>CTRL-H</b> and entering a name. By doing this you save the
      current map position and can go back to it at any time through the
      drop-down menu. If you are at an existing hotspot, you can delete it by
      pressing <b>CTRL-ALT-H</b>.
    </p>
    <p>By clicking on a region while holding down the CTRL-key you can
      select a region, or several with the mouse button held down. This way you
      can for example select regions to export as a CR. To deselect, click
      again with the CTRL-key held down. You may also select the current region
      by pressing the space bar.</p>
    <p>Right clicking a region results in a context menu that has the
      following options:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><b>Change selection state</b><br /> Allows you to select and
        deselect the current region like you were clicking it with the CTRL-key
        pressed.</li>
      <li><b>Copy name and coordinates</b><br /> Copies the name and
        coordinates to the clipboard.</li>
      <li><b>Set origin to this region</b><br /> Sets the origin of the
        coordinate system to the current region. This only applies to the
        display, a matching ORIGIN order is not issued to any unit.</li>
      <li><b>Set or delete hotspot</b><br /> Sets or deletes a hotspot
        corresponding to the current region. The name of the hotspot is set to
        the region's name.</li>
    </ul>
