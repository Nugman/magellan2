          <p>
            Atlantis is an open-ended computer moderated fantasy game for any 
            number of players. Players may attempt to carve out huge empires, 
            become master magicians, intrepid explorers, rich traders or any 
            other career that comes to mind. There is no declared winner of 
            the game; players set their own objectives, and one can join at 
            any time.
          </p>
          <p>
            A player's position is called a &quot;faction&quot;. Each faction has a name 
            and a number (the number is assigned by the computer, and used for 
            entering orders). Each faction is composed of a number of &quot;units&quot;, 
            each unit being a group of one or more people loyal to the 
            faction. You start the game with a single unit consisting of one 
            character, plus a sum of money. More people can be hired during 
            the course of the game, and formed into more units. (In these 
            rules, the word &quot;character&quot; generally refers either to a unit 
            consisting of only one person, or to a person within a larger 
            unit.)
          </p>
          <p>
            An example faction is shown below, consisting of a starting 
            character, Merlin the Magician, who has formed two more units, 
            Merlin's Guards and Merlin's Workers. Each unit is assigned a unit 
            number by the computer (completely independent of the faction 
            number), this is used for entering orders. Here, the player has 
            chosen to give his faction the same name (&quot;Merlin the Magician&quot;) 
            as his starting character. Alternatively, you can call your 
            faction something like &quot;The Great Northern Mining Company&quot; or 
            whatever.
          </p>
          <pre> - Merlin the Magician (17), faction Merlin the Magician (27), $2300, default
   order &quot;study magic&quot;.
 - Merlin's Guards (33), faction Merlin the Magician (27), number: 20, default
   order &quot;study sword&quot;.
 - Merlin's Workers (34), faction Merlin the Magician (27), number: 50,
   default order &quot;work&quot;.</pre>
          <p>
            A faction is considered destroyed, and the player knocked out of 
            the game, if ever all its people are killed or disbanded (i.e. the 
            faction has no units left). The program does not consider your 
            starting character to be special; if your starting character gets 
            killed, you will probably have been thinking of that character as 
            the leader of your faction, so some other character can be 
            regarded as having taken the dead leader's place (assuming of 
            course that you have at least one surviving unit!). As far as the 
            computer is concerned, as long as any unit of the faction 
            survives, the faction is not wiped out. (If your faction is wiped 
            out, you can rejoin the game with a new starting character.)
          </p>
          <p>
            The reason for having units of many people, rather than keeping 
            track of individuals, is to simplify the game play. The computer 
            does not keep track of individual names, possessions or skills for 
            people in the same unit, and all the people in a particular unit 
            must be in the same place at all times. If you want to send people 
            in the same unit to different places, you must split up the unit. 
            Apart from this, there is no difference between having one unit of 
            50 people, or 50 units of one person each, except that the former 
            is very much easier to handle.
          </p>
          <p>
            <br>
            
          </p>
          <h2>
            <span class="mw-headline" id="The_World">The World</span>
          </h2>
          <p>
            The Atlantis world is divided for game purposes into square 
            regions, each 50 miles on a side. Each region can have a terrain 
            type of Plain, Mountain, Forest, Swamp or Ocean. Regions can 
            contain units belonging to players, of course; they can also have 
            populations of peasants, as well as buildings (usually constructed 
            by players for the purpose of defense) and ships (constructed by 
            players for crossing oceans).
          </p>
          <p>
            A region's location is given as X,Y coordinates, e.g. if you are 
            in region 5,3 then to your east is 6,3 and south is 5,4. The 
            computer provides these for the convenience of players; region 
            coordinates are never entered in orders. Each region also has a 
            name; again, this is provided only for the convenience of players, 
            and is never used in orders.
          </p>
          <p>
            A turn is equal to one game month; every month is assumed to have 
            30 days for the sake of simplicity. (To maintain playability, the 
            distance and time scales are not always entirely realistic.) A 
            unit can do many actions at the start of the month, that only take 
            a matter of hours, such as buying and selling commodities, or 
            fighting an opposing faction. Each unit can also do exactly one 
            action that takes up the entire month, such as harvesting timber 
            or moving from one region to another. The commands which take an 
            entire month are BUILD, CAST, ENTERTAIN, MOVE, PRODUCE, RESEARCH, 
            SAIL, STUDY, TEACH and WORK.
          </p>
          <p>
            Any unit which is not given a command for a particular month will 
            repeat whatever it did last month. Movement commands are the 
            exception to this, so if a unit gets the command WORK in January, 
            then MOVE NORTH in February, and no command in March, it will 
            settle down to WORK again, rather than continue to MOVE NORTH. All 
            newly created units start off with WORK as the default command.
          </p>
          <p>
            <br>
            
          </p>
          <h2>
            <span class="mw-headline" id="Movement">Movement</span>
          </h2>
          <p>
            In one month, it is possible to move from a region to an adjacent 
            region. Each region has four adjacent regions, these being to the 
            north, south, east and west. Thus, to travel to a region 
            immediately northeast would take two months (unless powerful magic 
            is used). Also, to enter an ocean region, one must be on board a 
            ship. (Ships can enter ocean regions, or coastal regions with an 
            adjacent ocean region. They are always constructed in coastal 
            regions.)
          </p>
          <p>
            Movement can be prevented if the units are trying to carry too 
            much weight. If a ship is trying to sail from one region to 
            another, the capacity of the ship is compared with the total 
            weight on board. If the weight is greater, the ship cannot move. 
            The costs and capacities of the different types of ships are as 
            follows:
          </p>

          <p>
            People weigh 10 units each. Money has negligible weight. All other 
            items weigh 1 unit each, except for stone and horses, which weigh 
            50 each.
          </p>
          <p>
            For movement on land, the weight of people and horses is not taken 
            into account; instead, the capacity of a unit is equal to 5 per 
            person, plus 50 per horse; this must be no less than the weight of 
            other items being carried, or the unit will not be able to move.
          </p>
          <p>
            The rule for ship movement means that any number of characters can 
            be on board a ship, but there is a limit to how many the ship can 
            sail with. The first unit listed under a ship in the report is the 
            &quot;owner&quot;, this is the unit that created the ship in the first 
            place. Only this unit can issue SAIL orders for the ship.
          </p>
          <p>
            The owner can PROMOTE another unit, which then becomes the new 
            owner. If the owner leaves without promoting anyone, then the 
            first unit of the same faction on the ship is promoted. If there 
            are no other units of the same faction on board, then the first 
            unit on board is promoted. If there are no other units at all, and 
            the ship is at sea, then it sinks. Unoccupied ships in harbor 
            (i.e. in a coastal region) become owned by the first unit to board 
            them.
          </p>
          <p>
            Ownership of buildings is handled in the same way. Any number of 
            units can be listed as inside a building, but the number of 
            characters that can gain protection from it in combat is limited 
            by the building's size.
          </p>
          <p>

          </h2>
          <p>
            The most important thing distinguishing one character from another 
            in Atlantis is skills. The skills available are as follows:
          </p>
          <p>
            Mining Lumberjack Quarrying Horse Training Weaponsmith Armorer 
            Building Shipbuilding Entertainment Stealth Observation Tactics 
            Riding Sword Crossbow Longbow Magic
          </p>
          <p>
            Each unit can have one or more skills. These are gained by 
            training (using the STUDY command) and also by experience. It 
            takes 1 month of study for a unit to attain level 1 in a skill, 
            another 2 months to attain level 2, another 3 months to attain 
            level 3 and so on. (These don't have to be consecutive; to go from 
            level 1 to level 2, you can study for a month, do something else 
            for a month, and then go back and complete your second month of 
            study.)
          </p>
          <p>
            Each month of studying Tactics or Magic costs $200 per person (in 
            addition to the normal unit maintenance fee). Study of other 
            skills does not cost anything, apart from normal maintenance.
          </p>
          <p>
            If units are merged together, their skills are averaged out. No 
            rounding off is done; rather, the computer keeps track for each 
            unit of how many total days of training that unit has in each 
            skill. When units are split up, these days are divided as evenly 
            as possible among the people in the unit; but no days are ever 
            lost.
          </p>
          <p>
            A unit with a teacher can learn twice as fast as normal. The TEACH 
            command is used to spend the month teaching one or more other 
            units (your own or another faction's). The unit doing the teaching 
            must have a skill level greater than the units doing the studying 
            (the units doing the studying simply issue the STUDY command as 
            normal). Each person can only teach up to 10 students in a month, 
            so a unit of 20 trying to learn from a single teacher would gain a 
            total of 900 days of training per month (rather than the usual 600 
            or the optimum 1200).
          </p>
          <p>
            Note that it is quite possible for a single unit to teach two or 
            more other units different skills in the same month, provided that 
            the teacher has a higher skill level than each student in the 
            skill that that student is studying, and that there are no more 
            than 10 students per teacher.
          </p>
          <p>
            Mining, Lumberjack, Quarrying, Horse Training, Weaponsmith and 
            Armorer are used to produce commodities; this is covered in the 
            section on the economy.
          </p>
          <p>
            Building and Shipbuilding are used to construct buildings and 
            ships, respectively.
          </p>
          <p>
            Entertainment is used to earn money by entertaining the populace. 
            Each month spent entertaining will earn the performer $20 per 
            level of skill, as well as giving the performer the equivalent of 
            10 days training. However, the money earned from entertainment is 
            taken from the surplus available in the region, and no more than 
            1/20 of the amount available can be earned by entertainers in any

            entertainers.

            Stealth is used to hide units. A unit can only be seen if you have 
            at least one unit in the same region, with an Observation skill at 
            least as high as that unit's Stealth skill. However, units are 
            always visible when participating in combat; and a unit set on 
            guard, or in a building, or on board a ship, is also always 
            visible. You can only see which faction a unit belongs to if you 
            have a unit with Observation skill higher than that unit's Stealth 
            skill.

            The unit of currency in Atlantis is the silver piece, shown using 
            the dollar sign ($) for convenience. The dollar sign is shown on 
            reports only to make them easier to read; the sign is never 
            entered in orders, e.g. 500 silver pieces will be shown on the 
            report as $500, but should be entered in orders as just 500. The 
            words &quot;food&quot;, &quot;silver&quot; and &quot;money&quot; are here used interchangeably, 
            as one of the main uses for money is of course to buy food, but 
            for the sake of simplicity, the game does not bother to keep track 
            of these separately.
          </p>
          <p>
            <b>IMPORTANT:</b> Each and every person (player character or 
            peasant) in the Atlantis world requires $10 every month for 
            maintenance. Anyone who ends the month without this maintenance 
            cost available will starve to death. It is up to you to make sure 
            that your people have enough available. Food will be shared 
            automatically between your units in the same region, if one is 
            starving and another has more than enough; but this will not 
            happen between units in different regions.
          </p>
          <p>
            The primary commodities are silver/food, iron, wood, stone, and 
            horses; they are referred to as &quot;primary commodities&quot; because they 
            do not require raw materials to produce, but only labor.
          </p>
          <p>
            The peasants in a region produce food each month; some of this is 
            consumed directly, but some may be available as a surplus which 
            players can collect in tax.
          </p>
          <p>
            Player units can also be ordered to produce food, with the WORK 
            command. This requires no skill; a player character is equivalent 
            to a peasant in this context.
          </p>
          <p>
            The other primary commodities do require skill to produce. The 
            PRODUCE command is used to order a unit to mine/quarry/etc. one of 
            these commodities. A level of at least 1 in the appropriate skill 
            is required. The amount produced is proportional to the skill 
            level, e.g. a unit with skill 3 will produce three times as much 
            as a unit with skill 1. Of course, the amount produced is also 
            proportional to the number of people in the unit. The skill 
            required for each type of primary commodity is as follows:

            The amount produced also depends on the terrain type; different 
            types of terrain are better places for different types of economic 
            activity. The productivity values (how many units of the commodity 
            one person with skill 1 can produce in a month) are as follows:

            For example, if 20000 people (including peasants) were growing 
            food in a Plain region, each would get on average 1/3 of the 
            expected amount. If the skill levels involved are high, it takes 
            even fewer people to fully exploit the resources of a region. (For

            The construction of buildings works as follows: A new building can 
            be created at any time. All buildings start with a size of 0. Each 
            unit of construction work done on a building increases its size by 
            1, and requires one unit of stone. A month of work by a character 
            with Building skill of 1 can do one unit of construction work; a 
            character with skill 2 can do two units, etc.
          </p>
          <p>
            The construction of ships works similarly. A new ship can be 
            created at any time. However, until a number of units of 
            construction work equal to the ship's cost are done, the ship will 
            remain &quot;under construction&quot; and unable to move. Each unit of 
            construction work requires one unit of wood, and labor by

            It is possible for player units to collect taxes from the 
            peasants. If a unit issues the TAX command, the amount of income 
            collected is equal to $200 for every armed, combat-trained man in 
            the unit (i.e. a tax collector must have a sword, crossbow or 
            longbow, plus a skill of at least 1 in the use of the weapon). The 
            amount of money that can be collected is of course limited by the 
            amount available in the region (this is shown on the report for 
            the region).
          </p>
          <p>
            To safeguard one's tax income from other players, the GUARD 
            command can be used; if a unit is set on guard, this will prevent 
            a unit of any other faction from collecting taxes in the region, 
            unless the guarding faction has issued an ADMIT command for the 
            taxing faction. (Of course, a sufficiently powerful enemy can kill 
            the guarding units, and then collect taxes.)

            Each month, the peasant population in each region grows by 5% 
            (food supply permitting). To be exact, each peasant has a 5% 
            chance of producing another peasant. Each month also, 5% of the 
            peasants in each region migrate to a randomly selected 
            neighbouring region.

            One starts off a career as a magician in Atlantis by studying the 
            Magic skill. This is studied like any other skill, with the 
            exception that no faction may have more than three magicians at 
            any one time; any command that would cause this limit to be 
            exceeded simply fails. The reason for this restriction is that it 
            would completely change the atmosphere of the game to have players 
            accumulating large armies of magicians.
          </p>
          <p>
            Having acquired the appropriate skill, one can then learn spells. 
            Each spell has a difficulty level. It is possible to learn spells 
            whose difficulty level is no more than half your Magic skill, 
            rounded up, e.g. at skill level 3 you can start learning 
            difficulty 2 spells. (It is reasonable to assume that magicians 
            have other abilities in the game world, but the spells provided 
            are what is relevant in terms of game rules.)
          </p>
          <p>
            The basic method of acquiring spells is to research them. Each 
            month spent researching results in one previously unknown spell 
            being acquired (the computer selects the spell at random from 
            those available). When issuing a RESEARCH command, it is necessary 
            to specify the level to be researched (the default is the highest 
            possible level). If no more spells exist at that level, this will 
            be noted on your report for next month. Research costs $200 per 
            month.
          </p>
          <p>
            Note, however, that while you can learn spells whose difficulty is 
            no more than half your Magic skill, rounded up, you can only 
            research spells whose difficulty is no more than half your Magic 
            skill, rounded down. Thus, you can start learning difficulty 2 
            spells at skill level 3, if given them by someone else; but you 
            cannot research them yourself until skill level 4.
          </p>
          <p>
            An easier way to acquire spells is to be given copies of them. A 
            magician who knows a spell can give a copy to another magician 
            with the appropriate skill. This does not take a significant 
            amount of time, so an entire library of spells can be copied in a 
            single month without interfering with research or other activities.
          </p>
          <p>
            Once spells are learned, they can be cast. There are two basic 
            types of spells in this regard. One type takes a whole month of 
            involved ritual to cast (spells for creating magic items, for 
            example, fall into this category). The CAST command is used for 
            this.
          </p>
          <p>
            The other type of spell is cast in mere seconds; combat spells 
            fall into this category. The way to order a magician to cast these 
            is with the COMBAT command which sets the combat magic spells a 
            magician will use. Once a magician has been ordered to have a 
            particular combat spell prepared, he will from then on 
            automatically use it whenever he is involved in fighting of any 
            kind. Casting combat spells in battle does not interfere with the 
            casting of ritual spells that month.
          </p>
          <p>
            Each month spent either researching spells or casting a ritual 
            spell gains the magician the equivalent of 10 days study of the 
            Magic skill.
          </p>
          <p>
            Magic items can be created by means of certain ritual spells. 
            These are handled in the same way as ordinary items as regards 
            things like the GIVE command. Should you ever buy, steal or be 
            given a magic item created by someone else, however, remember that 
            possession of the item does not necessarily mean you know how to 
            use it.
          </p>
          <p>

          <h2>
            <span class="mw-headline" id="Combat">Combat</span>
          </h2>
          <p>
            Combat occurs when a unit issues an ATTACK command. The computer 
            then gathers together all the units on the attacking side, and all 
            the units on the defending side, and the two sides fight until an 
            outcome is reached. In this section, &quot;attacker&quot; means the unit 
            that originally issued the ATTACK command, and &quot;defender&quot; means 
            the unit that was the target of the command.
          </p>
          <p>
            On the attacking side are all the units of the attacker's faction, 
            that are in the region. Also are all other factions, one of whose 
            units issued an ATTACK command against the defender's faction. 
            This means that if several factions are attacking an enemy, each 
            attacking faction need only have one of its units issue an ATTACK 
            command against one of the target faction's units, and the 
            attackers will automatically fight together. You cannot attack 
            your own units, or an ally's units.
          </p>
          <p>
            On the defending side are all the units of the defender's faction. 
            Also are all other factions which are allied to the defender. If 
            the defender is the peasants of the region, then any factions 
            which have a unit on guard will fight on the side of the peasants. 
            (If several factions are planning to attack one, they should not 
            only all issue ATTACK commands, but make sure they are allied as 
            well (using the ALLY command), in case the enemy gets in an attack 
            first, and picks them off piecemeal.)
          </p>
          <p>
            The computer first checks which unit on each side has the best 
            Tactics skill; the unit with the best Tactics is assumed to be 
            leading all the troops on that side. If one side's leader has a 
            higher Tactics skill, then that side gets a free round of attacks.
          </p>
          <p>
            In each combat round, the combatants each get to attack once, in a 
            random order. (In a free round of attacks, only one side's forces 
            get to attack.) Each combatant will attempt to hit a randomly 
            selected enemy. If he hits, and the target has no armor, then the 
            target is automatically killed. Chain mail gives a 1/3 chance of 
            surviving a hit, and plate armor gives a 2/3 chance.
          </p>
          <p>
            For a soldier using a sword against an enemy soldier similarly 
            equipped, whether he hits or not is decided by a contest between 
            the two Sword skills. Against an enemy with a bow, the contest is 
            of Sword skill versus an effective skill of -2. (It is difficult 
            for an archer to defend himself against a swordsman in 
            hand-to-hand combat.)
          </p>
          <p>
            For a crossbow, whether the target is hit is decided by a contest 
            of Crossbow skill versus 0. For a longbow, the contest is of 
            Longbow skill versus 2 (a longbow is considerably more difficult 
            to use than a crossbow). This disadvantage is offset by the fact 
            that a longbow can be fired every round, whereas a crossbow takes 
            two rounds to reload after being fired (so it fires on the first, 
            fourth, seventh etc. rounds).
          </p>
          <p>
            Unarmed combatants are assumed to be fighting with knives, 
            pitchforks or other improvised weapons; they are treated as if 
            they were using swords, but with an effective skill of -2. (A 
            combatant with a weapon, but without a skill of at least 1 in its 
            use, is treated as unarmed. Combatants with more than one weapon 
            will select the first one with which they have a skill of at least 
            1.)
          </p>
          <p>
            A swordsman with a horse, and with Riding skill of at least 2, 
            gains a bonus of 2 to his effective Sword skill, provided that the 
            region terrain is Plain; horses are of little use in battle in any 
            other terrain.
          </p>
          <p>
            People inside buildings gain protection; there is a penalty of 2 
            for anyone to hit them. (This is true even if they are on the 
            attacking side.) The maximum number of people who can gain 
            protection from a single building is equal to the building's size.
          </p>
          <p>
            The contest of skills works as follows: The attacker's and 
            defender's skills are compared (here &quot;attacker&quot; and &quot;defender&quot; 
            mean the individual soldiers, without reference to who issued the 
            original ATTACK command). The chance of hitting is determined by 
            which skill is higher, and by how much:

            Example: if a soldier with a Sword skill of 3 is trying to hit one 
            with a Sword skill of 2, there is a 40% chance of success. If the 
            attacker's skill is more than 1 greater than the defender's, there 
            is a 49% chance of success; if the defender's skill is more than 1 
            greater, there is only a 1% chance.
          </p>
          <p>
            Particularly valuable or lightly-armed units can be protected 
            using the BEHIND command. Any unit with the BEHIND flag set is 
            considered to be at the rear of the battle, and cannot be attacked 
            by any means until all the troops in front on that side have been 
            killed. However, units at the back cannot use swords, only missile 
            weapons.
          </p>
          <p>
            A magician using a combat spell is considered to be using a 
            missile weapon, and can attack even while BEHIND. A magician 
            without a combat spell set will fight with normal weapons like 
            everyone else. The battle report will indicate which magicians 
            cast what combat spells, if any.
          </p>
          <p>
            After the free round of attacks (if any), comes the main part of 
            the battle. Combat rounds are fought until one side is wiped out. 
            (Realistically, it is reasonable to assume that some of the troops 
            on the losing side have fled and dispersed into the countryside. 
            Either way, they are no longer with their faction.)
          </p>
          <p>
            Finally, the dead are counted. Any money or items owned by dead 
            combatants on either side are collected by the winning side; the 
            loot is distributed evenly among the troops, so factions on the 
            winning side will generally pick up loot in proportion to their 
            number of surviving men. However, any items other than iron, wood 
            or stone, whose owners are killed, have a 50% chance of being 
            destroyed in the fighting, e.g. if 50 swordsmen are killed, the 
            winners will pick up about 25 swords.
          </p>
          <p>
            Every armed soldier on the winning side gains the equivalent of 10 
            days study with the weapon he was using. Magicians who were using 
            a combat spell gain the equivalent of 10 days study of the Magic 
            skill. In addition, the leader of the winning side gains the 
            equivalent of 10 days study of Tactics. However, these skill gains 
            only happen if the winning side took at least one casualty (so 
            that the victory was at least something of a challenge).
          </p>
          <p>
            Combat between units on board ships at sea is handled exactly like 
            land combat, except that horses can't be used in naval battles.
          </p>
          <p>
            If you are expecting to fight an enemy who is carrying so much 
            equipment that you would not be able to move after picking it up, 
            and you want to move to another region later that month, it may be 
            worth issuing some orders to drop items (with the GIVE 0 command) 
            in case you win the battle!
          </p>

          <p>
            To enter orders for Atlantis, you should send a mail message (no 
            particular subject line required), containing the following:
          </p>
          <pre>  #ATLANTIS faction-no

  UNIT unit-no
  ...orders...

  UNIT unit-no
  ...orders...

  #END</pre>
          <p>
            For example, if your faction number (shown at the top of your 
            report) is 27, and you have two units numbered 5 and 17:
          </p>
          <pre>  #ATLANTIS 27

  UNIT 5
  ...orders...

  UNIT 17
  ...orders...

  #END</pre>
          <p>
            Thus, orders for each unit are given separately, and indicated 
            with the UNIT keyword. (In the case of orders, such as the command 
            to rename your faction, that are not really for any particular 
            unit, it does not matter which unit issues the command; but some 
            particular unit must still issue it.)
          </p>
          <p>
            Several sets of orders may be sent for the same turn, and the last 
            one received before the deadline will be used.
          </p>
          <p>
            IMPORTANT: You MUST use the correct #ATLANTIS line or else your 
            orders will be silently ignored.
          </p>
          <p>
            Each type of order is designated by giving a keyword as the first 
            non-blank item on a line. Parameters are given after this, 
            separated by spaces or tabs. Blank lines are permitted, as are 
            comments; anything after a semicolon on a line is treated as a 
            comment and ignored.
          </p>
          <p>
            The parser is not case sensitive, so all commands may be given in 
            upper case, low case or a mixture of the two. However, when 
            supplying names containing spaces, the name must be surrounded by 
            double quotes, or else underscore characters must be used in place 
            of spaces in the name. (These things apply to the #ATLANTIS and 
            #END lines as well as to order lines.)
          </p>
          <p>
            Any player not sending in orders for four turns in a row is 
            removed from the game, e.g. if your last set of orders was for 
            turn 20, you will receive reports for turns 20, 21, 22, 23 and 24; 
            your turn 24 report will contain a request to send orders; and you 
            will not receive a turn 25 report. Note that an empty order set 
            still counts as sending in orders.
          </p>
          <p>
            IMPORTANT: If you are dropped from the game for not sending 
            orders, your faction is completely and permanently destroyed, and 
            is NOT retrievable. Please contact the moderator if you have 
            difficulty getting orders through.

          <p>
            It is necessary to issue an ACCEPT command to receive things given 
            with any of the following commands: GIVE, PROMOTE, TEACH, TRANSFER.

            If any of your units issues this command, then any unit of the 
            target faction will be admitted into any building owned by you, or 
            aboard any ship owned by you, and allowed to collect taxes in any 
            region you are guarding, for the duration of the month. The ADMIT 
            status only lasts for a single month. ADMIT status is always 
            assumed for allies.

          <p>
            If you ally with a faction, then your units will fight to defend 
            units of that faction when they are attacked. ALLY faction-no 1 
            allies with the indicated faction. ALLY faction-no 0 cancels this.
          </p>
          <p>
            The ALLY status also implies ACCEPT and ADMIT status, i.e. you 
            will always ACCEPT and ADMIT any faction you are allied to.

            will first leave the current building or ship. The command will 
            only work if the target ship is unoccupied, or is owned by a unit 
            in your faction, or is owned by a unit in a faction which has 
            issued an ADMIT command for you that month.

            building number specified will perform work on that building. 
            BUILD BUILDING alone will create a new building and perform work 
            on it. BUILD SHIP with a ship number specified will perform work 
            on that ship. BUILD LONGBOAT, CLIPPER or GALLEON will create a 
            ship of the indicated type and perform work on it.
          </p>
          <p>
            Note that since the number of a newly created building or ship is

            FORM alias

          <p>
            Forms a new unit. The newly created unit will be in your faction, 
            in the same region as the unit which formed it, with the same 
            BEHIND and GUARD status, and in the same building or ship, if any. 
            It will start off, however, with no people or items; you should, 
            in the same month, issue orders to transfer people into the new 
            unit, or have it recruit new members.
          </p>
          <p>
            The FORM command is followed by a list of commands for the newly 
            created unit. This list is terminated by the END keyword, after 
            which commands for the unit issuing the FORM command start again.
          </p>
          <p>
            The purpose of the &quot;alias&quot; parameter is so that you can refer to 
            the new unit. You will not know the new unit's number until next 
            month. To refer to the new unit that month, pick an alias number 
            (the only restriction on this is that it must be at least 1, and 
            you cannot create two new units in the same region in the same 
            month, with the same alias numbers). The new unit can then be 
            referred to as NEW alias in place of the regular unit number.
          </p>

            Example:
          </p>
          <pre>  UNIT 17
  FORM 1
      NAME UNIT &quot;Merlin's Guards&quot;
      RECRUIT 20
      STUDY SWORD
  END
  FORM 2
      NAME UNIT &quot;Merlin's Workers&quot;
      DISPLAY UNIT &quot;wearing dirty overalls and carrying shovels&quot;
      RECRUIT 50
  END
  PAY NEW 1 1200
  PAY NEW 2 3000</pre>
          <p>
            This set of orders for unit 17 would create two new units with 
            alias numbers 1 and 2, name them Merlin's Guards and Merlin's 
            Workers, set the display string for Merlin's Workers, have both 
            units recruit men, and have Merlin's Guards study swordsmanship. 
            Merlin's Workers will have the default command WORK, as all newly 
            created units do. The unit that created these two then pays them 
            enough money (using the NEW keyword to refer to them by alias 
            numbers) to cover the costs of recruitment and the month's 
            maintenance.

            <br>
            GIVE unit-no quantity item GIVE 0 quantity item GIVE unit-no spell
          </p>
          <p>
            The first form of the command gives a quantity of an item to 
            another unit. If the target unit is not a member of your faction, 
            then its faction must have issued an ACCEPT command for you that 
            month.
          </p>
          <p>
            The second form of the command discards a quantity of an item. The 
            items discarded are permanently lost.
          </p>
          <p>
            The third form of the command gives a copy of a spell to another 
            unit. The other unit must have sufficient Magic skill to 
            understand the spell, and its faction must have issued an ACCEPT 
            command for you that month.

            <br>
            GUARD flag
          </p>
          <p>
            GUARD 1 sets the unit issuing the command to guard the peasants of 
            the region against attack, or taxation by other factions (except 
            those for which one has issued an ADMIT command). GUARD 0 cancels 
            this.

            MOVE direction

          <p>
            The unit will move in the specified direction (NORTH, SOUTH, EAST 
            or WEST). This command is for use on land only; use SAIL to move 
            in a ship.

            Changes the name of your faction, or of the unit, or of a building 
            or ship (of which the unit must currently be the owner). The name 
            can be up to 80 characters. All entities start off named &quot;Unit 5&quot;, 
            &quot;Faction 23&quot; or whatever until they are given proper names. Names 
            may not contain brackets (square brackets can be used instead if 
            necessary).

            Pay another unit the specified amount of money (does not require 
            the target unit's faction to have issued an ACCEPT command). PAY 
            PEASANTS will give the money to the peasants of the region, and 
            PAY 0 will simply throw it away.

            which the unit issuing the command is currently the owner. If the 
            specified unit is not a member of your faction, then its faction 
            must have issued an ACCEPT command for you that month.

            Quit the game. Your faction number must be provided as a check to 
            prevent Quit orders being issued by accident. On issuing this 
            order, your faction will be completely and permanently destroyed.

            RECRUIT number
          </p>
          <p>
            Attempt to recruit the specified number of people into the unit. 
            Each person recruited costs $50 (this is either paid as 
            compensation to their previous employers, or paid to the new 
            recruits as a signing-on fee, who then spend it in the local 
            tavern celebrating their new employment status).
          </p>
          <p>
            The total number of people who can be recruited in a region in one 
            month is 1/4 of the number of peasants in the region. If more 
            RECRUIT orders than this are issued, the available recruits are 
            distributed at random among the units issuing the orders.
          </p>
          <p>
            Since new recruits have no skills, a trained unit which takes in 
            recruits will find its skills diluted.

          <p>
            Spend the month researching a spell at the specified difficulty 
            level. For example, a magician with a magic skill of 4 or 5 can 
            research spells of up to level 2. If the level is not specified, 
            the research will be at the highest possible level.

          <p>
            When a unit in your faction researches, or is given a copy of, a 
            new spell for the first time, your report will contain a paragraph 
            of information on the spell. The RESHOW command will show this 
            information again, in case you lose the report that originally 
            showed it. This only works if there is still at least one unit in 
            your faction that knows the spell.

            only be done in a coastal region, as sinking one's ship at sea 
            would be suicide.

            specified unit is not a member of your faction, then its faction 
            must have issued an ACCEPT command for you that month. The 
            TRANSFER PEASANTS order will transfer the people into the peasant

          <p>
            Make sure to use the correct #ATLANTIS and UNIT lines in your 
            orders.

          <p>
            Be careful not to lose any people through starvation. It is a good 
            idea to store a month's supply of money in each region in which 
            you have units, as a safety measure.
          </p>
          <p>
            Don't try to do everything at the start; pick a particular 
            occupation to specialize in, and trade with other players for 
            anything else you need. You can always diversify later, when you 
            have the resources.
          </p>
          <p>
            Keep an eye on what the other players are doing, so as not to miss 
            opportunities for profitable trade, or get caught in a surprise 
            attack. Remember, in time of war there is safety in numbers.
          </p>
          <p>
            Remember to use ACCEPT and ADMIT where necessary.
